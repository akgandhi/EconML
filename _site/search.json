Among those sold under cost, the average margin is -9.1%.\r\n\r\nExisting theories that may explain:\r\nIntertemporal price discrimination (Hendel and Nevo, 2006, 2013). However, it cannot explain why products are sold under cost because the stores can always earn profits from both searchers and non-searchers under the assumption of intertemporal price discrimination.\r\nLoss leader strategy. Stores may want to offer deep promotions on some products to attract consumers to the store to shop for other products, and maximize the overall profit. We may need to investigate transaction data to confirm whether it is true.\r\nInventory management. Some products are perishable, and stores may want to sell them before they perish. Inventory information is available, but more work is needed to investigate whether inventory management is a reason for deep discounts.\r\n\r\nResearch Plan\r\nRead full data. We have not been able to read the full assortment, which is more than 700 GB in size. We are actively working with HPCC to resolve the problem.\r\nConduct more detailed descriptive analyses, and nail down the research question.\r\nChoose appropriate methods to answer the research question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
